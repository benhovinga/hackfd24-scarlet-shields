Instructions to Install Python 3 on Windows:

1. Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
2. Under the "Stable Releases" section, download the latest version of Python 3 by clicking on the "Windows installer" link.
3. Run the downloaded installer and make sure to check the "Add Python to PATH" option during the installation process.
4. Once the installation is complete, open the Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and run the following command to verify Python 3 is installed:
   python --version

If Python 3 is installed correctly, you should see the version number printed in the Command Prompt.

5. If you encounter any issues or the python command is not recognized, you may need to add Python to the system PATH manually:
   - Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables"
   - Click on "Edit the system environment variables"
   - Click the "Environment Variables" button
   - Under "System Variables", scroll down and find the "Path" variable, then click "Edit"
   - Click "New" and add the path to your Python installation (e.g., C:\Python39\ for Python 3.9)
   - Click "OK" to save the changes and close all windows

After following these steps, Python 3 should be installed and configured correctly on your Windows system. You should then be able to run the KaliLinux_PythonCoding.py script without any issues.
